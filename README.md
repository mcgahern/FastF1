# FastF1
Various files exploring the FastF1


Explanation of the Files:

1. Bahrain_16vs44 *
  Compares the lap times of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton for the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix, which would have been Leclerc's first victory for Ferrari bar the engine issues he suffered late in the race. 
  
2. HamVsBottas *
  Two purple sectors on his way to what was looking like the fastest lap of the race, Valterri heard the infamous "Valtteri, it's James, please abort the fastest lap attempt before the end of the lap". He still set the fastest lap, which was then taken away from him by his teammate Lewis Hamilton a few laps later. This file compares the speed, throttle and braking points of both of their fastest laps to see where the time was lost. 
  
3. Monza_RicciardoVsMax *
  The famous collision of Verstappen and Hamilton lead to McLaren and Daniel Ricciardo's first win of the Zach Brown era for the team. But what would have happened if the collision didn't occur, would Ricciardo have beaten the Red Bull on it's own pace ? This file uses the availible information to make a prediction for this scenario.
  
4. Vettel_Comparison_Monza
  I wanted to do a comparison over the last 4 years of Sebastian Vettel's last 4 Monza fastest qualifying laps. This year with his new team in Aston Martin, 2020 with one of the worst Ferrari's made, 2019 with the illegal engine and 2018 with an also fast Ferrari. 
  
5. Sochi_Tyres *
  Lando Norris was minutes away from his first win in F1 when his fateful decison to stay out on the slick tyres as it began to rain down in Sochi. This file compares the fastest tyre in each minisector, with the user able to select each lap
  
6. Championship_Race *
  The 2021 drivers championship race was one of the tightest we've ever seen. See how the entire grid evolved through the season.
